  <h1> ABOUT US </h1>
  <p> ELMI is a furniture design company located in Brooklyn, NY founded in 2006. We pride ourselves on selling
products that truly stand out. Our work pays homage to the Scandinavian history of
craftsmanship and materiality, whilst challenging the contemporary forms of today. Elmi’s success demands that we provide the highest quality service to our customers. This approach includes product performance that matches or exceeds the best in the marketplace. In addition, we must recognize that we all have a key role in supporting Elmi’s corporate social responsibilities, which address our ethics, our health and safety protocols, our quality control, and our environmental impact. </p>
